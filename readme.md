This applciation is an Real-time Chatting Website Supporting Multiple Users.
In this application, I used Laravel, Vue.js, and MySQL to implement a local based chating website. Firstly, a user can create an account and it would be stored in SQL database, and the user can log in and send messages in a chatting window.

◦ Vue Components: Used Vue components to build a chatting room interface. 
◦ Laravel PHP Framework: Used Laravel framework to build a user registration and login framework. 
◦ MySQL Database: Used MySQL to store Users' information and chatting messages. 
◦ Used Pusher to implement Echo on front end: Used Even broadcasting and Echo to refresh messages on the  chatting interface. 

This application is developed on Phpstrom.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications.
